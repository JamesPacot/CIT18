            <h2>Expectations</h2>
            <p>
                I expect that this subject will be fun and challenging at the same time. I expect that this subject will help me grow in my field with the help of our instructor. I expect my instructor to be approachable whenever we need explanations on something. For my classmates, I expect them to be helpful especially to my groupmates, and I also expect them to be cheerful towards each other.

            <h2>Motivations</h2>
            <p>
                God is my first motivation because I know that He will guide me through the challenges. Second is my family because I want to pass this subject so that I can graduate early, and because I want to give back to my parents for everything they have done.

            <h2>Contributions</h2>
            <p>
                I will be present at all times, and I will not be late in this class as much as possible. When working in groups, I will participate in every activity and make sure that I contribute well. I will listen in every discussion and ask questions if there is something I do not understand.

            <h2>Hindrances</h2>
            <p>
                My biggest hindrance in this subject is my time management since I am a student athlete and we have an upcoming national competition this semester. My time is really tight this semester, but I believe I am going to manage it well since this is not the first time.
